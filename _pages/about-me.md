My story starts exactly how it is stated on the [welcome page](/) of this site.
I was very active as a young man, but when I got invested in my career in
college I essentially reduced my activity down to zero and allowed myself to eat
a very poor diet. This resulted in me gaining a lot of weight. In fact, at my
biggest I was 310lbs. The first few pictures you see here are of me at my
biggest. 

I really didn't process how unhealthy and out of shape I was until after
becoming a professor and teaching classes. This required me to stand on my feet
for 75 minutes multiple times a day. It turned out my back just couldn't handle
standing for longer than 15 minutes before it started to spasm. I also struggled
to tie my shows each day, because I couldn't reach down far enough even when I
was sitting. I never dared to sit on the floor--something I actually like to do
oddly enough--because I couldn't breath nor sit in a comfortable position. 

Even though I was super out of shape I dreamt of getting in shape again, and
being able to do the things I used to do like skateboard, ride my bike, go on a
vacation (where I had enough energy to actually do things other than eat), tie
my shoes, sit on the floor, or go for a run. Honestly, I often got jealous when
I saw people out doing these types of things. I would ask myself, why can't I do
it? So one day, I was fed up, and I decided the answer is that I can do it! 

In fact, I remember that day vividly. It was a Saturday, I felt so clear headed,
and I knew that it was time for me to really change. I was so pumped up I
grabbed my old skateboard from before college, and went outside to try to see if
I could still do an ollie (jump up on the skateboard). I did it in the grass,
because honestly, I was kind of scared. I could still do one even at 300+ lbs. I
felt like it was a sign from the universe that I really should start my journey.

I started on my nutrition first. Let me just give you an idea on how I used to
eat.  I ate out for every meal including snacks. I never cooked at home, and I
would eat candy and drink soda like it was nobodies business. I would often have
Hardee's breakfast (sausage and gravy with scrambled eggs and strawberry jelly
on top), then for lunch I would often have tex mex, like a burrito with all the
good stuff like queso, after that I would stop by the gas station and buy some
sort of gummy candy and a king size candy bar, and for dinner, steak house or
pizza was always a favorite. For desert, usually Cold Stone Creamery and I
always got the got-to-have-it size with all kinds of candy thrown in there. As
you can probably guess I was addicted to sugar and ate a ton of calories per
day.  My serving size was always the biggest I could get, and I would eat it all
no matter what. This had to change.

I started very slowly. At first my main goal was to try and buy groceries to eat
at home. Some of these trips were so difficult, I would rush through the store
with my head down so that I didn't see any of the bad foods I was trying to cut
out. I always reminded myself, I just need to get the good food home. I never
want to lie, especially to my clients, changes like these are difficult. You
will make mistakes, but the consistency over time is what matters most. I
managed to start eating at home regularly, and even fell in love with cooking
and baking. I realized I could have a lot of really good food if I cooked it
myself, because I knew exactly what was in it. I started to loose weight with
just these changes and no added activity.

After beginning to improve on my nutrition I started to add more activity. At
first, I added walks at work. About every few hours I would walk around campus
to get steps in. After a bit of that, I started to jog at a local track a few
times a week. I would get super sore from just this, so it took me a bit to get
in shape enough to do anything else. After I was feeling a bit more comfortable
I bought a bike and I started riding it every where I could. I rode to work
every day, and even to go and get my groceries. This experience made me realize
how easy it is to exercise when you enjoy the exercise. I was getting in hours
of activity a day, because I was riding my bike all over town. It didn't seem
like I was exercising, but I was!

Improving my nutrition and adding in more activity really helped my fitness and
health improve. I dropped several sizes in my clothes and started sleeping
better and feeling better. Fast forward a few years and I met who is now my
wife. She played roller derby, and found out that I used to skateboard and
rollerblade. I asked if guys can play roller derby, because I always thought of
it as a women's sport. It turns out that there are male and co-ed teams. So I
started learning how to play roller derby with her team.

Honestly, I fell in love with the sport. I excelled at it, because I've been
skating for so long. But, I learned pretty fast just how out of shape I was. My
mobility was really bad, so I couldn't get into proper position most of the
time. My balance and coordination struggled, because my muscles were so weak.
So to help get better in shape for roller derby I started to do extra training
at home. I did a little research and I learned that with just a kettle bell and
my body I could do a lot of different workouts. 

My additional training focused around hip strength and agility. I learned a lot
from these early workouts and just how hard I able to push myself. I have never
before nor sense experienced as much soreness as those first few months with my
kettle bell. However, my fitness improved a lot, and I started to see more
weight coming off.
