# On Boarding

When a client first signs up for a program I send out a welcome email containing the following:

1. The coach/athlete contract.
2. Payment information.
3. The on-boarding form.

The coach/athlete contract is an agreement that I ask every client to sign. It
simply lists out everything I expect from my clients and everything my clients
can expect from me. For example, the payment agreement, the times of the day I'm
available to respond to messages, and the most important expectation I have of
my clients which is for them to try their best.

The payment information contains all the ways you can pay for your training each
month. The exact day will be up the client, but once set should remain
consistent unless arrangements have been made in advance.  

Finally, the on-boarding form is a quick form that every client fills out that
asks for their current basic health and fitness information like age, height,
weight, the date they would like to start their training, and some other basic
questions that I use to get to know the client a bit better.

# The Program

<div class="row">
     <div class="col-sm">
<p>After the onboarding process I create your training program and then share it
with you through your <strong>Client Portal</strong>. Everything related to your training program
can be found in the portal. There is a section called <strong>Program</strong> which lists each
training cycle you've completed. An example athlete portal is shown to the right.</p>

<p>Typically, training programs are broken up into 4, 8, or 12 cycles depending on
the client and their goals. The 4 week cycle is the most popular. This ensures
that we are building fitness without getting too bored. </p>

# Weekly Check-Ins

Each week on Sunday and Monday I read over all of my clients feedback for the
week and collect questions and messages of support into a weekly check-in
message I'll send privately to each client. These weekly check-ins give me a
chance to track how my clients are progressing, answer questions they have, and
give advice for how they should proceed the following week. I always stay in
constant contact with all of my clients on a weekly basis. In addition to these
weekly check-ins, clients are welcome to message me any time on WhatsApp.
